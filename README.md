# Snek-Game
Creating the quintessential snake game with Python
Game has been created using the PyGame library working on PyCharm
An executable file could not be created as we had some problems with the PATH variables in an unknown environment
To run the script, open main.py on an IDE (like PyCharm) and run it (Ctrl+Shift+F10, or Ctrl+Option+R on Mac, for PyCharm)
